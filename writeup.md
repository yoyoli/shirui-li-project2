•	What were some challenges you faced while making this app?

I have trouble to fix the problem when I try to calculate the bomb around the clicked cell. After I develop the function, the website is keep loading but it shows all right in the terminal. Also, I take some time to design make the link thing more organized: home – play(difficulty) & Rule. 


•	Given more time, what additional features, functional or design changes would you make

I finished the task that right click to add the flag but didn’t calculate the number of left bombs, I might can develop that. Also, I can add the function that can saved data when user left the website. And another big thing that will be interesting to do is add auto clear. 


•	What assumptions did you make while working on this assignment?

I assume that the player will play the game on computer. I mean they can still play it on a small screen, but it will be more comfortable when they play it on a laptop. 


•	How long did this assignment take to complete?

Around a day. And some other time to set up and write this writeup assignment.


•	(Optional) Any feedback on this challenge?  What did you like or not like about implementing this project?

I like the request the 4 different React components part. I think that help me understand the react and develop the project more organized.
